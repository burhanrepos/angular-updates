these are new features of angular 15:

-> Stable Standalone APIs:
    -> (command for standalone) ng g c standalone-component --standalone
    -> this will not dependent on any component it will import in the component.ts file which things are required.

-> Introducing a New API System
  -> Directive Composition ;
      <div appStyle appColor appFontWeight>
        <!-- Content here Before -->
      </div>

      after: inside appStyle we use this in side @Directive
      hostDirectives: [
        { directive: ColorDirective, inputs: ['color: mycolor'] },
        { directive: FontWtDirective, inputs: ['weight: myweight'] },
        { directive: ClickEmitDirective, outputs: ['appEmit: clickEmit'] },
      ],

      and all this is possible inside standalone direcitve + project

-> Debugging Made Easy With Improved Stack Traces

-> Improved Experimental ESbuild Support

-> Single File Components

-> More Stable Image Directives

-> Stabilized MDC-Based Components
